# Switch Them All!

"Switch Them All!" is a little Puzzle Quest (more precisely a Match-3 game with levels and ennemies) I developped in Python/Pygame with two friends on my first year at the university. This is my first development project, please don't be too careful about the code quality ;)

Requires : Python 3, Pygame

Launch the game with the following line :
$ python3 Src/main.py

You will find a little game manual into the main menu.

If you want to play the game with the progression system, edit the Src/main.py file :
Replace line 12 by 
PROGRESSION = 1
