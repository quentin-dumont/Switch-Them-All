#Switch Them All!

"Switch Them All!" is a little Puzzle Quest (a Match-3 game with levels and ennemies) I developped in Python/Pygame with two friends on my first year at the University of Caen (january to april 2022). This is my first development project, please don't be too careful about the code quality ;)

Requires : Python 3, Pygame

Launch the game with the following line :
$ python3 Src/main.py

If you want to know entirely the game rules, I made a game manual on the last 'RAPPORT.pdf' page.
